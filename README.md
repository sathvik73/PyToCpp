# live-py3-to-cpp-converter README

Py2Cpp is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension that uses the Gemini API to seamlessly convert Python3 code into equivalent C++ code. Designed for developers working in both Python and C++, this tool helps automate the translation process, making it faster and easier to port Python projects to C++. Whether youâ€™re translating functions, classes, or entire scripts, Py2Cpp simplifies the process, saving you time and effort. Integrated directly with VS Code, it offers smooth, intuitive code conversion within your development environment.
